for a) if we comment out using namespace std; from the file then then the compiler searches 
for the cin, cout, endl,etc and cannot find the standard library and causes errors. 
In order to fix this problem we can use std::cin, std::cout, std::endl in every cin, cout, endl etc.

for b) if we connment out Critter:: the normal function cannot access the variable inside the class because it is private.
The possible solution normal function can access variable of class if those variables are public. So we should change 
it to public.
